1) Caesar Cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code or Caesar shift, is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.

The goal of this project is to implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string.
For example,

> caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
=> "Bmfy f xywnsl!"
